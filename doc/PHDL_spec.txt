= PHDL Language Specification =
Version 0.0.0, Unreleased

== Requirements ==

The PHDL language is intended to be a simple hardware description 
language (HDL) for printed circuit board (PCB) design. The objective is 
to replace graphical schematic editors.

With that in mind, we believe that the PHDL language has the following requirements. Some
of these are strict requirements that arise from the nature of the task; others
arise from an attempt to use good practices that are in line with a solid
architecture and ease of use by a vibrant community.

== Basic Information ==

To create a design each component type must be declared, each net must be declared,
then components are instantiated and their pins connected to nets. Hierarchical 
design entry must also be supported. Therefore every design must contain the 
following information.


* Design
** Design Name

** Components - for each component:
*** Device Name
*** Device attributes
**** Required Attributes
**** Optional Attributes
**** User Attributes
*** Pins
**** Pin Name
**** Pin Numbers
**** Pin Attributes ???

** Ports - for each port:
*** Net Declaration
**** Net Name
**** Net Range
**** Net attribute ???

** Nets - for each Net:
*** Net Declaration
**** Net Name
**** Net Range
**** Net attribute ???

** Instances - for each instance:
*** Instance Name
**** Component Type
**** Instance Attributes
**** Pin-Net Assignments

** Subdesigns - for each subdesign:
*** A Complete SubDesign with the same structure as a Design but
created for instantiation in a larger design.

== Example Design ==
The best way to communicate how any computer language works is by providing some good example code. This section contains the PHDL code for a tiny board design that contains all the elements of the PHDL language.

(I would like to make these code sections collapsible but I don't know if asciidoc supports that.)

=== Device Definitions ===
It is good practice to put all the device definitions for your design in a separate file. This file is called devices.phdl.
