PHDL Language Specification
===========================
Version 0.0.0, Unreleased

Requirements
------------

The PHDL language is intended to be a simple hardware description 
language (HDL) for printed circuit board (PCB) design. The objective is 
to replace graphical schematic editors.

With that in mind, we believe that the PHDL language has the following requirements. Some
of these are strict requirements that arise from the nature of the task; others
arise from an attempt to use good practices that are in line with a solid
architecture and ease of use by a vibrant community.

Basic Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a design each component type must be declared, each net must be declared,
then components are instantiated and their pins connected to nets. Hierarchical 
design entry must also be supported. Therefore every design must contain the 
following information.


* Design Name

** For each component:
*** Device Name
*** Device attributes
**** Required Attributes
**** Optional Attributes
**** User Attributes
*** Pins
**** Pin Name
**** Pin Numbers
**** Pin Attributes ???

* For each Net:
** Net Declaration
*** Net Name
*** Net Range
*** Net attribute ???

* For each instance:
** Instance Name
*** Component Type
*** Instance Attributes
*** Pin-Net Assignments

* For each subdesign:
** A Complete SubDesign with the same structure as a Design but
created for instantiation in a larger design.

The following example code will illustrate the language.
